* tryAddEntity(): 
   * placed it in WorldModel because the addEntity method is in WorldModel even though some parameters may be a different class
* moveToFull(): 
   * placed it in Entity because the method uses a little more Entity properties such as position than WorldModel properties
* scheduleActions():
   * Entity class because although the event schedule is called a lot in this method, the parameters are overwhelming Entity attributes
* parseBackgroundRow():
   * it uses various components from other classes, but the WorldModel class has the private variable background which is harder to access from other files, so WorldModel is selected.
